## üíª Description

A ecommerce API to practice back-end skills. I want to simulate a usecase that an app 
would be used to thousands of users, and this project is a solution to this usecase in specific.

## üóíÔ∏è To do

 - [ ] Develop main functionalities 
   - [x] Create account (as store administrator and as client)
   - [x] User can login and logout
   - [x] Publish a product
   - [x] List products 
   - [x] Edit product price, name and stock
   - [ ] Archive product
   - [ ] Buy a product using a credit card 
   - [ ] Send email when the payment is confirmed
   - [ ] Favorite a product
 - [ ] Make a load balacing with Nginx
 - [ ] Make a load balacing in the database (and study the different strategies)
 - [ ] Use Message Queue Tool to long-awaited routes/process (buy a product)

## Convention

### Issue name convention

Use a short and descriptive name for the problem or request.

Example: `Add feature Archive product`

### Branch name convention

Use the category of the changes e.g. `feat`, `test`, the number of the issue in `(#issue-number)-issue` and a short description to summarize the meaning of the changes like `archive-product`

Example: `feat/issue-01/archive-product`

### Pull Request Naming

Use the issue number `[#issue-number]`. Followed by the issue title to end all.

Example: `[#01] Add feature Archive product`
